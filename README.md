Project Title:

Draw It or Lose It - Web-Based Game Development

Overview
This project aims to redesign and extend the Android-only game "Draw It or Lose It" into a web-based platform, supporting cross-platform compatibility for Mac, Windows, Linux, and mobile devices. The goal is to replicate the app's core features while enhancing user experience and expanding accessibility.

Key Features

Team and Player Management:
Support for multiple teams, each with unique players.
Unique game and team names to prevent duplication.
Singleton Pattern:
Ensures only one instance of the game exists in memory.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Optimized for Mac, Windows, Linux, and mobile devices.
User-Friendly Design:
Intuitive UI/UX design with tutorials for new and returning users.
System Architecture

Implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance and abstraction.
Utilizes a UML-based domain model to detail class relationships, inheritance, and implementation requirements.
Employs a singleton pattern to manage unique game instances.
Design Constraints

Challenges Addressed:
Budget: Managed scope and feature set within financial constraints.
Time: Defined realistic timelines to balance development and delivery.
Features: Prioritized essential features to match platform limitations.
User Experience: Maintained user-friendly interfaces and seamless functionality.
Development Requirements

Platform	Server-Side	Client-Side	Development Tools
Mac	Expensive hosting, licenses required.	Swift expertise required.	MacBook with Xcode.
Linux	Lightweight, customizable, free.	Linux programming knowledge.	Eclipse, CLion.
Windows	Common, secure, expensive licenses.	.NET Framework expertise.	Visual Studio, CLion.
Mobile	OS variation, not ideal for hosting.	Proficiency in UI/UX.	Android Studio, Unity.
Recommendations

Platform: Windows for its stability, cost-effectiveness, and developer familiarity with languages like C++ and C#.
Storage Management: Combination of HDD for servers and SSD for workstations to balance capacity and performance.
Memory Management: High RAM systems for efficient data processing and reduced latency.
Distributed Systems: Cloud-based hosting for reliability, scalability, and reduced downtime.
Security:
Role-based access controls for clear separation of responsibilities.
Network management tools to monitor and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

Application of OOP principles to software design.
Strategic architectural decisions for multi-platform compatibility.
Consideration of constraints like budget, time, and user experience.
Implementation of secure, scalable, and maintainable systems.
